This line of code uses Python's f-string formatting to print out the explained variance ratio of the PCA components. The pca.explained_variance_ratio_ attribute is an array that contains the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

For example, if your dataset has four features and you've reduced it to two components using PCA, the output might look like this:
Explained variance ratio: [0.92461872 0.05306648]
This indicates that the first principal component accounts for approximately 92.46% of the total variance, and the second accounts for about 5.31%. Together, these two components explain 97.77% of the variance in the data. This is useful for determining how much information you're retaining after reducing dimensions.
